# Winning Jeopardy

## Task

Jeopardy is a famous television game show in the US where participants answer questions to win money.

In this project, I have been working with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help me win. 
Further, I applied the [chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) to assess the statistical significance of the difference between expected and observed occurences of specific words within two categories of the questions.

The project is proposed by the e-learning plattform [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/)
