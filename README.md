# Winning Jeopardy

Jeopardy is a famous television game show in the US where participants answer questions to win money.

In this project, I have been working with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help me win. 
Further, I applied the [chin-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test){:target="_blank"} to assess the statistical significance of the difference between expected and observed occurences of specific words within two categories of the questions.

The project is proposed by Dataquest which is plattform of data science e-learning : [link](https://www.dataquest.io/){:target="_blank"}
